Overview
This Go program demonstrates how to rotate a string by a given number of characters. It takes an input string and shifts the characters to the right, effectively rotating the string.

In this example, the string "abcdef" is rotated by 4 positions, and the output is "efabcd".

How it Works
The string to be rotated is defined as x.
The number of characters to rotate by is defined by y.
The length of the string is calculated and used to wrap the rotation around the string.
The program first appends the characters starting from position y to the end of the string and then appends the first part (from index 0 to y-1) to complete the rotation.
Code Explanation
The variable x is the string to be rotated.
y is the number of positions to rotate the string.
The length of the string is calculated using len(x).
y = y % z ensures that y is within the bounds of the string's length.
The first loop appends the substring starting from index y to the end of the string.
The second loop appends the substring from the start of the string to index y-1.
The final result is printed to the console.
Example Output
Given the input string "abcdef" and y = 4, the program outputs:

Copy code
efabcd
Usage
Install Go.

Save the program in a .go file (e.g., string_rotation.go).

Run the program using the Go command:

bash
Copy code
go run string_rotation.go
Modify the input string x or the value of y in the code to test different scenarios.
